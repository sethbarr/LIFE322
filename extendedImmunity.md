 <!-- Kin association is pretty common, in particular in non reproductive animals. This has been linked to the Major histocompatibility complex in a variety of species including tadpoles. The MHC is highly polymorphic because it’s involved in recognising infectious disease abut has also been used as a good marker of relatedness.
Class I MHC – circle, class II squares based on percent similarity at the MHC

Here data from aphids, showing that the reproducting rate of unchallenged individuals is higher than those given an injection of dead bacteria (gram pos or neg, or fungus) but all are higher than sterile stabs. This shows 1) cost of wounding, but compensation by increased reproduction relative to those that didn’t get a challenge with antigens.
